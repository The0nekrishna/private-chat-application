# private-chat-application

in this project i created a privet chat application using PHP with MySQL & JavaScript. In this chat app, first we have to signup. After successfully signed up, we will be redirected to the users area page where users signed to this chat app will appear there with their full name, profile image, active status and so on. 

we can select any user to start to chat with them. You can also easily log out from the chat application by clicking on the logout button and after successful logout, we  will be redirected to the login page of the chat app and our status will be offline for other signed-up users. we have to log in with your signed-up email and password to enter the chatting page again.
